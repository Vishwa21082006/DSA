Searching Algorithms in DSA

This repository contains implementations and explanations of fundamental **searching algorithms** used in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Searching is an essential concept in computer science, used to locate a specific element in a data structure like an array, list, or tree.

| Algorithm              | Description                                               | Works on Sorted Data |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Linear Search          | Searches element one by one                               | ‚ùå                   |
| Binary Search          | Divides sorted array into halves to find element          | ‚úÖ                   |
| Jump Search            | Jumps ahead by fixed steps, then linear search            | ‚úÖ                   |
| Exponential Search     | Doubles the range until target found, then binary search  | ‚úÖ                   |
| Interpolation Search   | Uses interpolation formula to guess the position          | ‚úÖ                   |
